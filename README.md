# XiaolinMod
Plugin tries to imitate Xiaolin Showdown TV show mechanics. Players can move and jump very fast. There are also Shen Gong Wu's, the ancient artifacts that give player special powers.

There are three bars, Stamina bar, Chi Energy bar and Shen Gong Wu bar. Stamina bar determinates if we can still do high jumps and dashes. Chi Energy bar tells us if we still have energy to use Shen Gong Wu. The last bar shows the time remaining for the Shen Gong Wu to dissapear.

Shen Gong Wu's are appearing on the map as the round progresses. Players can pick them up and use immediately.
